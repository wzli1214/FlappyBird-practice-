This is the Flappy Bird repo. 
I practice this as an opportunity to learn JavaScript, as well as applying the knowledge of interactive multimedia design in the hands-on project.

Flappy bird is developed in JavaScript/HTML5, using phaser framework.

But if you would like to execute this app on web, you need a local server environment, like, MAMP (on mac).
